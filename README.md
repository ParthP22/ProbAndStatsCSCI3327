This is my repository consisting of the projects that I completed in Probability and Applied Statistics at Stockton University (CSCI 3327).

Project 1:
- BirthdayProgram: calculate the probability of at least 2 people having the same birthday in one room
- StatsLibrary: various functions that are used to calculate probabilities and probability distributions
- CarFactory: create at least 1000 cars, print their data to a .csv file, and view the results in Excel
- PokerHands: calculate the probabilities of 9 poker hands, once for a hand of size 5, and again for a hand of size 7
- ThreeDoorsProbability: calculate the probability of winning Monte's Three Doors Problem for two different scenarios
