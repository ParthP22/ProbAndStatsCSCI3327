/* Answer to question 2.20 on page 34
   a. If the contestant has no idea which curtains hide the various prizes and selects a curtain at
   random, assign reasonable probabilities to the simple events and calculate the probability
   that the contestant selects the curtain hiding the nice prize.

   Answer: the probability that the contestant selects the curtain hiding the
   prize is 1/3, since there are 3 possible events in the sample space, where
   the probability of each is 1/3.

   b. Before showing the contestant what was behind the curtain initially chosen, the game show
   host would open one of the curtains and show the contestant one of the duds (he could
   always do this because he knew the curtain hiding the good prize). He then offered the
   contestant the option of changing from the curtain initially selected to the other remaining
   unopened curtain. Which strategy maximizes the contestantâ€™s probability of winning the
   good prize: stay with the initial choice or switch to the other curtain? In answering the
   following sequence of questions, you will discover that, perhaps surprisingly, this question
   can be answered by considering only the sample space above and using the probabilities
   that you assigned to answer part (a)

   Answer: The contestant's probability of winning the good prize actually doubles to 2/3 instead
   of 1/3, because when being allowed to switch after seeing which door had a dud, your probability
   of winning on your second chance will increase to 1/2, since you now only have 2 choices, as
   opposed to having 3 choices.
